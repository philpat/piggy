                                    <p>PiggyVest (formerly piggybank.ng) is a simple app that helps you save and invest with ease. With PiggyVest, you can stop
                                         spending excessively and put away (and grow!) funds that you do not want to touch.</p>
                                         <p>You can choose to save little amounts of money periodically (Daily, Weekly or Monthly) towards a specific target OR lock away funds for a specified period of time. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>We take away the stress by <strong>combining simplicity, discipline, convenience, and flexibility</strong>  to enable you to manage your finances better and achieve financial freedom.
                                    </p>
                                        <h6>How do I know what plan is right for me </h6>
                                        <p>All of the savings and investment options on Piggyvest are tailored towards a particular need. 
        
                                            If you'd like to regularly put away money for your savings and withdraw only once a quarter, then the <strong>Piggybank</strong> wallet is right for you. You can set it so that money is taken from your account and you don't have to worry about saving manually. 
                                            If you're saving towards a particular goal such as rent or travel, <strong>Target Savings</strong>  is a great option. You can invite friends and make it a fun challenge to smash all your financial goals. 
                                            If you're looking for something geared towards the long term, The <strong>SafeLock</strong>  feature is perfect for you. With higher interest rates, you could lock away funds you don't need access to and make even more money by doing so. 
                                            If you're looking to get started on investments or diversify your portfolio, then pre-vetted, low-risk investment opportunities are regularly available on Investify to help you grow your money.</p>
